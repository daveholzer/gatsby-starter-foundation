title: About Paseo de Palomas
---
Paseo de Palomas was built in the 1960’s, before personal computers, smart appliances, multiple television sets, microwave ovens, toaster ovens, and other electric appliances were in common use, or even existed.

The park was built to meet codes, specifications, and building practices in use at the time. Today’s electrical usage demands are higher than the park was designed to accommodate. Our sewer, water and gas lines do have sufficient capacity, but these components degrade over time and eventually need to be replaced. These items comprise the main park infrastructure components to be covered in this document.

Fortunately, most of the infrastructure has held up pretty well. For the last few years we’ve had a few sewer problems that have been repaired. We’ve had no natural gas related issues or breakdowns. The few underground water pipe issues have been due to shovel damage while digging fence post holes. We’ve had at least one pin-hole leak in a water line riser. We had one electrical failure several years ago, with the cause thought to be a PG&E surge.

A recent HCD park inspection brought to our attention the potential for serious problems with our electrical infrastructure. We were advised by the HCD inspector to have our underground electrical cabling inspected and assessed, as the direct burial cable has a limited lifetime before the insulation fails, resulting in serious electrical problems.

The board of directors is in the process of assessing the park’s infrastructure in order to plan for needed upgrades over the next several years. This document is the plan for how that will be accomplished.

We assume the park will be here for many years to come, and it is incumbent on the current residents to upgrade the components as necessary to ensure that the park continues to be a great place for older persons to live and retire. It is the board’s responsibility to ensure the corporation and the park are maintained in good operating condition for current and future residents.

The infrastructure project is too complex and long-running to manage without a plan. The plan will help ensure continuity, as the project time scale will span several board generations.
