  This plan includes the park’s major infrastructure components. Each component
  section describes the plans for how the component condition will be assessed,
  the various options available to address issues, cost, schedules, and how the
  work will be financed. For the purpose of this report, these components are:

  Sewer lines from coach connection to the city sewer system

  Electric main service from PG&E entrance to the park owned substations

  Buried electric cable from park substations to the coach connections

The park’s purchase mortgage was paid in full in 2014. Rather than reduce the monthly rent by $146 per resident, the board at the time wisely decided to start allocating that amount to the Sustained Maintenance Reserves (SMR) fund. That allowed the fund to grow by $186,000 per year, minus planned SMR expenses. 

The board also engaged Applied Research Analysis (ARA) to perform an onsite reserve funding analysis. A reserve funding analysis report is required for shared residential developments to help ensure funds are being set aside to pay for needed repairs as components wear out. The report was updated in 2020, adding the sewer line components.

Fortunately for all of us, Pat Tinto has worked tirelessly over the past 10+ years to ensure that the park has adequate reserves in the SMR fund for these large infrastructure projects. The CFO often has the unpopular and thankless job of pushing for increased allocations for future repairs. We thank her for that now.

The portion of rent money diverted to the SMR fund increases 3% each budget year starting in 2020 when it was increased to $15965/month. In 2021 it will increase to $16443/month. This increase is necessary to properly fund the SMR account for future infrastructure repair costs.

The chart below shows two metrics used by reserve analysis: percent funded and starting balance by year. The starting balance is the total of the SMR fund at the beginning of the plan year. The dip in 2021 is mainly the estimated $350,000 expense for the electrical service upgrade. The percent funded drops to 32% after this major expense, which is lower than recommended. Subsequent dips every 2-3 years are sewer line replacements, estimated at $200,000 each, and adjusted for inflation. The major dip in 2044 is for repaving the roads.
